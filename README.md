# advocating for yourself

This may be a shot in the dark here but I want this job so bad that I'm going to shoot my shot here!

Netflix, please allow me to explain to you why I'm the PERFECT person for this position:
- I led all organic social for every DC Comics original title on HBO Max
- In only around 3 months from acquiring control of the former DC Universe show titles, I tripled all of their social followings (DC's Doom Patrol, DC's Titans) while each show was in-between seasons with a fan-centric, community management approach. All organic. Not a penny in paid social to boost following.
- As the Social Media Manager for the Snyder Cut, I launched and managed all of the official accounts - leading the official Twitter account to over 50k followers within the first 10 minutes of launch
- James Gunn once referred to me as "some genius at HBO Max" in conversation with John Cena and Steve Agee about who was in charge of the Peacemaker social accounts
- My fan-centric approach to managing large fandoms has led to 4 Shorty Awards and 1 Clio Award
- The organic social strategy I was able to develop for DC Comics titles led to millions of organic impressions across comic industry trades for the SUCCESSFUL risks we took with our IP and super-serving our audience

I eat, sleep, and breathe this culture!

If any of my network could connect me with the hiring managers for this role or even just help me elevate this post by sharing/reacting/commenting for reach that would be the biggest help!
